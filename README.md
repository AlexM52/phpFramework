<h1>phpFramework</h1>

<h4> Background: </h4> <i>I've always found PHP somewhat problematic,
especially when trying to rapidly develop a new web project. So I thought
that having a framework of sorts that would allow me to quickly implement 
and test new PHP projects without having to fiddle around with lots of 
code, often having to start from scratch and re-invent the wheel, would be
quite useful. And so here we are.</i>

<h3>Main Goal:</h3> Provide a simple base or template on which to build
PHP-based websites/apps.

<h3>How?:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provide PHP 'libraries' to import for ease of use</li>
    <li>Provide functions for commonly used actions</li>
    <li>Provide secure database access that can be easily configured for
    use with a wide range of DBMSs.</li>
    <li>Provide a single 'centralized' config file to quickly and easily set up
    various PHP application configurations (DB type and access credentials, 
    constant definitions and any other details...)</li>
    <li>Provide PHP templates for common page types, as well as for server-side
    AJAX handling</li>
    <li>(Possibly) provide a client-side JavaScript component for handling AJAX 
    and other common JS functions, customized for use with the server-side PHP 
    component</li>
</ul>
